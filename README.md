Run main.py for GUI version

If you are not interested in GUI you can simply run the no_gui.py

Created all by myself. No cheating.

:)

__NOTE__

*For the GUI version, weather.py, main.py and images/sky.png should be on the same directory (sky.png should be in a folder named 'images' in the same directory) and main.py should be executed to start the program.

*For the no_gui version, only the no_gui.py and weather.py is required. no_gui.py should be executed with an os (in a terminal or a command prompt) to run the program.
